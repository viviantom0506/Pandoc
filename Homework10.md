Homework \#10

Tools I used for this semester

GitHub

-   Used this to upload files for homework assignments and updating the
    > class project.

-   Pros: All my homework assignments are able to be accessed anywhere
    > and won't be deleted unless I type in the repository name and
    > confirm that I actually want to delete it. GitHub also allows
    > everyone in the class to be able to collaborate in one place
    > online and be able to upload everything into one specific
    > repository with designated folders for each team.

-   Cons: I never needed to use GitHub until this class which required
    > me to learn how to use GitHub such as setting up repositories,
    > cloning, and more.

Terminal

-   Used this for Homework assignment \#1, \#3, Pandoc, and \#6.

-   Pros: It is very flexible in the sense that it can be used for many
    > different things such as running Java programs, Python programs,
    > creating a database, downloading things such as flask or sqlite3.

-   Cons: It was confusing to learn the new commands for each different
    > homework assignments because using SQLITE had different commands
    > compared to Python.

Slack

-   Used this for the class group project in order to keep in contact
    > with everyone as the project progressed.

-   Pros: We were able to have two separate channels where the main
    > channel involved all of the teams and another channel that only
    > involved the Product team. Slack allowed us to send links,
    > pictures, and screenshots of code to see if we were able to fix
    > anything or had any opinions on designs and more.

-   Cons: They could maybe have a "read" section where we can see who
    > has already read that chat but other than that Slack has been very
    > helpful this entire semester.

Google Slides

-   Used for individual presentation and group presentation.

-   Pros: Allowed not only one individual but many individuals to access
    > all at once and make changes that would automatically save. It was
    > very easy to use and didn't require everyone needing to update a
    > slide if one person updated it.

-   Cons: None.

SQLITE

-   Used for homework \#6.

-   Pros: SQLITE is easy to learn because there is a website with all
    > the commands and what the commands are used for and writing the
    > code was easy.

-   Cons: It was hard to learn how to create a database at first and
    > even the lack of a ";" in the code will mess things up and won't
    > even allow you to write the next command in Terminal.

Repl.it

-   Used for homework \#5.

-   Pros: It is easy access because all you need is the internet and you
    > don't need to install any software or anything onto the computer
    > which saves storage in the computer.

-   Cons: None.

Travis

-   Used for homework \#8

-   Pros: Allowed for continuous integration and deployment, makes any
    > changes you made on your git repository that is connected and runs
    > until it is deployed or it is over 10 minutes.

-   

Notebook/Pens/Adobe

-   Used for the group class project.

-   Pros: Allowed us to draw designs out and many layouts.

-   Cons: None.

Pandoc

-   Used for extra credit assignment, and homework assignments \#6,9,10.

-   Pros: It helps convert documents to md, pdf and more.

-   Cons: It was extremely hard to download pdflatex because google
    > would have so many different ways to install and even if there was
    > a way to download it onto my Mac my terminal wouldn't be able to
    > locate pdflatex. It took me a long time to find homebrew and
    > install pdflatex.
